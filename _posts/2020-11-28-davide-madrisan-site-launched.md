Well. Finally got around to putting this website together.

Powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and the [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/)
template language and I can even use [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
to author my posts (if I'm too lazy to write in HTML).
It actually was a lot easier than I thought it was going to be because of the
great [Jonathan McGlone's project](https://github.com/hankquinlan/hankquinlan.github.io/)
that helped me putting all the pieces toghether.

Hosted by [GitHub](https://github.com/madrisan/madrisan.github.io) with :heart:
