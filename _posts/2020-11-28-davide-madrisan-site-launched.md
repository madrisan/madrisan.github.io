Well. Finally got around to putting this website together.

Powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and the [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/)
template language and I can even use [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
([kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/) to be precise) to author my posts
(if I'm too lazy to write in HTML).
The layout is enriched by the usage of
[Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/), the
[Font Awsome](https://fontawesome.com/) and some
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) too.
It actually was a lot easier than I thought it was going to be because of the
great [Jonathan McGlone's project](https://github.com/hankquinlan/hankquinlan.github.io/)
that helped me putting the main pieces toghether.

And last but not least it's possible to write beautiful *LaTeX*-formatted mathematical
expressions with the [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) JavaScript display engine.
For instance my preferred identity: $$ e^{i \pi} = -1 $$.
