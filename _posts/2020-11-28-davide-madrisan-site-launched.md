## My new site is born

Well. Finally got around to putting this website together.

Powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and
hosted by [GitHub](https://github.com/madrisan/madrisan.github.io) with :heart:
and I can use Markdown to author my posts.
It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be.
