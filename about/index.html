            <p>I’m an open source and Linux enthusiast hacker since 1996, an auto-entrepreneur,
               a Linux senior DevOps, a Developer, Cloud, Web, Data Science and Machine Learning passionate,
               with a strong musical, mathematical and networking background.
               That’s a bit unusual mix of interests and experiences I guess.</p>
            <p>I live and work in Nice, in the south east of France, since 2008.</p>

                        <p>I was born and raised in Torino, in north west of Italy, and I did all my schooling in this town.
                        Besides being a student at the Conservatoire of Music "G.Verdi", I also did fairly well in school.
                        So I had my <i>Bachelor of Music-Piano Performance</i> in 1993 (class of Maestro Domenico Canina) and
                        a <i>Master of Mathematics</i> degree at the <i>Università degli Studi</i> in 1999, with emphasis in
                        Computer Science, Mathematical and Graphics programming, Cryptography, and Artificial Intelligence.
                        Research thesis: "<i>Algorithms for Searching Saddle Points in Convex Analysis and their application
                        to the Monotonic, Regular and Optimized interpolation</i>."</p>

                        <p>Having worked for over twenty years, I began to feel as though my knowledge about many interesting
                        things was fading out, so I decided it was time for reinvention.
                        Then I heard about MOOCs – <i>Massive Online Open Courses</i>, and a specific one turned out appealing to me:
                        “<i>Machine Learning</i>”, from Coursera-Standford University, nicely taught by Andrew Ng.</p>

                        <p>Therefore, in 2014 I fell in love with online training via MOOCs.
                        My main objective at the beginning was learning about interesting subjects from some top-notch
                        universities, like MIT, Harvard, Berkeley, Chicago, Yale or Stanford, and I also wanted to live the
                        experience of collaborative learning, though I did not have a clear strategy.
                        However, after the first MOOC I started to plan ahead.</p>

                        <p>Since then, step by step and week by week, I successfully completed several MOOCs
                        (and dropped many too), and as a result I am learning a couple of things about Machine Learning,
                        Data Science, Maths, Functional/Object Oriented/Parallel and GPGPU Programming, Cloud Computing,
                        DevOps Technologies, Web Technologies, Learning Technics, and so on.
                        More recently I added Health and Climate Science related courses to my learning objectives.</p>

                        <p>In May 2020 I moved to new position as <i>Software Engineer</i>
                        and in May 2021 as <i>Site Reliability Engineer</i> at Qwant,
                        focusing mainly on <i>Continuous integration</i> with GitLab CI and applications deployment on
                        Kubernetes with Helm and ArgoCD.</p>

                        <h5>Infrastructure Lead DevOps</h5>

                        <p>I started working in september 2017 at Qwant, the French startup company that develops the eponymous web
                        search engine that respects the user's privacy. I've worked as <i>Infrastructure Lead DevOps</i> with
                        an expertise in the <i>Infrastructure as Code</i> good practices and technologies
                        (the <i>SaltStack</i> framework essentially), Docker containerization, and Python programming.</p>

                                <p>I became an auto-entrepreneur in 2013 (SIRET: 79212659100025).
                                My projects are mainly focused on <i>Linux embedded</i> (operating system and multimedia on the Raspberry Pi),
                                on networking and <i>AWS cloud technologies</i> and on Full Stack and MEAN stack <i>web development.</i></p>

                        <h5>Monitoring Architect and Team Leader</h5>

                        <p>I switched in october 2011 to a very enriching job as <i>Nagios/Centreon monitoring architect</i>,
                        <i>developer</i>, and <i>team leader</i> of the Nagios monitoring team (France and Poland)
                        at IBM La Gaude. I ended my job experience at IBM in june 2014.</p>

                        <h5>Linux and VMware Certified Engineer</h5>

                        <p>Between 2007 and 2011 I worked at <i>IBM Italy</i> and than <i>IBM France</i> as a Linux and VMware system
                           administrator in high pressure working environments. In particular at IBM SSO France, I was assigned
                           on multiple client Linux support and gained <i>incident management</i>, <i>compliance</i> and
                           <i>process skills</i> in a very strict <i>ITIL</i> and <i>GDF</i> environment.</p>

                        <h5>Linux distribution developer</h5>

                        <p>My primary technological interest since 1999 is studying and hacking the Linux environment and playing
                           with the latest open source technologies.</p>

                        <p>Between 2003 and 2006 I had a wonderful experience as a Linux distribution developer and team leader
                           (<i>QiLinux</i> distribution) which involved me into many different activities, ranging from the conception,
                           creation from sources and integration of all the pieces and technologies of a modern Linux distribution
                           to the software development, debugging and compliance with the available standards.
                           Since 2007 I started developing on the
                           <a href="https://openmamba.org/en/"><i>openmamba</i></a> <i>GNU/Linux</i> distribution with roots in the
                           discontinued <i>QiLinux</i> distribution but which has quickly moved to a fully independent project.</p>

                        <h5>Network WAN Engineer</h5>

                        <p>In 1999 I started to work in the private IT and Telecommunication sectors as <i>Cisco WAN Engineer</i>.
                           Between 2001 and 2003 I worked at the Atlanet Internet Service Provider (now part of British Telecom)
                           in the Network Delivery team and gained in-depth Cisco technology knowledge in network planning,
                           implementing, configuring, troubleshooting and testing of MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching)
                           networking systems.</p>

                        <h5>TeX Developer</h5>

                        <p>My very first job experience (1998-1999) was the development of a collection of TeX macros and document
                           styles written in pure <i>plain</i>TeX language for the Academy of Science of Torino.
                           The aim of this project was to create a document style to easily write Mathematics and Physics
                           papers in <i>plain</i>TeX, but with the Microsoft Word Look&amp;Feel (sic!), because other academic
                           people unfortunately made use of this second typetting tool to redact their papers and we didn't want
                           to see any visual differences in the final rendered document.
                           The most difficult part was impletementing a complete support for the TrueType fonts, not natively
                           available under <i>plain</i>TeX.</p>

                           <p>You can see the code in my
                              <a href="https://github.com/madrisan/TeX-macros/tree/master/astmacro">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

                        <p>When I’m not working, I spend my time studying, taking MOOC’s, playing with my dog <i>Pixi</i>,
                        listening lots of classical music, taking care of my plants (crassulaceae, succulents and cactaceae)
                        reading books, travelling a bit when possible, and developing some open source
                        <a href="{{ site.socials.github }}">projects</a>.</p>

                        <p>My preferred composers are (at present, it's somewhat fluctuating over the time) Johann Sebastian Bach,
                        Gustav Mahler, Anton Bruckner, Arnold Schoenberg, Alban Berg, and Dmitri Shostakovich.
                        As you can maybe guess from this list, I particular love symphonic and polyphonic music.
                        But my preferred "classical" piece is perhaps the crystalline
                        <i>Five movements for string quartet, op. 5</i> of Anton Webern.</p>
