	<h1>About myself</h1>
</div>

<div class="about">
	<p>I’m an open source and Linux enthusiast hacker since 1996, an auto-entrepreneur,
	   a Linux senior DevOps, a Developer, Cloud, Web, Data Science and Machine Learning passionate,
	   with a strong musical, mathematical and networking background.
	   That’s a bit unusual mix of interests and experiences I guess.</p>
        <p>I live and work in Nice, in the south east of France, since 2008.</p>

        <h2>EDUCATION</h2>

	<p>I was born and raised in Torino, in north west of Italy, and I did all my schooling in this town.
	   Besides being a student at the Conservatoire of Music "G.Verdi", I also did fairly well in school.
	   So I had my <i>Bachelor of Music-Piano Performance</i> in 1993 (class of Maestro Domenico Canina) and
	   a <i>Master of Mathematics</i> degree at the <i>Università degli Studi</i> in 1999, with emphasis in
	   Computer Science, Mathematical and Graphics programming, Cryptography, and Artificial Intelligence.
	   Research thesis: "<i>Algorithms for Searching Saddle Points in Convex Analysis and their application
	   to the Monotonic, Regular and Optimized interpolation</i>."</p>

	<h3>Network WAN Engineer</h3>

	<p>In 1999 I started to work in the private IT and Telecommunication sectors as <i>Cisco WAN Engineer</i>.
	   Between 2001 and 2003 I worked at the Atlanet Internet Service Provider (now part of British Telecom)
	   in the Network Delivery team and gained in-depth Cisco technology knowledge in network planning,
	   implementing, configuring, troubleshooting and testing of MPLS (Multiprotocol Label Switching)
	   networking systems.</p>

	<h3>Linux distribution developer</h3>

	<p>My primary technological interest since 1999 is studying and hacking the Linux environment and playing
	   with the latest open source technologies.</p>

	<p>Between 2003 and 2006 I had a wonderful experience as a Linux distribution developer and team leader
	   (<i>QiLinux</i> distribution) which involved me into many different activities, ranging from the conception,
	   creation from sources and integration of all the pieces and technologies of a modern Linux distribution
	   to the software development, debugging and compliance with the available standards.
	   Since 2007 I started developing on the
	   <a href="https://openmamba.org/en/"><i>openmamba</i></a> <i>GNU/Linux</i> distribution with roots in the
	   discontinued <i>QiLinux</i> distribution but which has quickly moved to a fully independent project.</p>

	<h3>Linux System Administrator and Monitoring Architect</h3>

	<p>Between 2007 and 2014 I worked at <i>IBM Italy</i> and <i>IBM France</i> as a Linux system administrator
	   in high pressure working environments, as <i>Nagios/Centreon monitoring architect</i> and
	   <i>developer</i>, and finally as <i>team leader</i> of the IBM IMS Infrastructure group in La Gaude.</p>

	<h3>Auto-entrepreneuriship</h3>

	<p>I became an auto-entrepreneur in 2013 (SIRET: 79212659100025).</p>

	<img src="../images/logo_os2_banner.png" alt="OS2 Logo">

	<p>My projects are mainly focused on <i>Linux embedded</i> (operating system, multimedia on the Raspberry Pi),
	   on networking and <i>AWS cloud technologies</i> and on Full Stack and MEAN stack <i>web development.</i></p>

        <h3>Infrastructure Lead DevOps and Software Engineer</h3>

	<p>I’m currently work at Qwant. I started working as <i>Infrastructure Lead DevOps</i> with expertise in
	   the Infrastructure Management, Docker containerization and Python programming, and moved
	   in May 2020 to a new position as a <i>Software Engineer</i>.
